# 42_get_next_line
This is my, meanwhile improved, solution for the get next line project from 42 school.
I also included a Makefile, main file and text file, which are not allowed in the project, so they are only included for testing purposes!

## Details
- I achieved 100 points.
- Paco and paco -s works flawless as well ([Tester](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette))
