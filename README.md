# 42_get_next_line
My solution for the get next line project from 42 school. I achieved 100% with an older version and optimized it a bit further.

I also included a Makefile, main file and text file, which are not allowed in the project normally so it is only for testing purposes.
Paco as well paco strict works 100% with my solution.
